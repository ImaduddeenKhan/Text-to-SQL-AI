# Text-to-SQL-AI

## Overview
This project enables users to convert natural language queries into SQL statements and execute them on a preloaded dataset. The system is designed to simplify database interactions by leveraging NLP models, making it easier for non-technical users to extract insights from structured data.
 
## Usage
- Open the frontend in a browser.
- Type a natural language query (e.g., "Show me the data of data science students").
- The system converts it into SQL and executes it on the preloaded dataset.
- Results are displayed in a tabular format with optional visualizations.
